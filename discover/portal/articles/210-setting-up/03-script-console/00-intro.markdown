# Using Liferay's Script Engine [](id=using-liferays-script-engine)

@product@ provides a robust script engine for executing
[Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)
scripts. You can execute scripts in the engine from the scripting console.  You can execute scripts to perform maintenance tasks like data cleanup, user maintenance operations, bulk invocations of Liferay's
API, or even system level operations.

These tutorials cover the following scripting topics: 

- [Invoking Liferay services](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/invoking-liferay-services-from-scripts)

- [Running scripts from the script console](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/running-scripts-from-the-script-console)

- [Using the script engine with workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/leveraging-the-script-engine-in-workflow)

- [Script examples](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/script-examples)

Invoking Liferay's services is discussed first because it's part of the most
common scripting tasks. If you're familiar with Liferay's API, this will be very
easy for you.
